<br> When a day is said and done, 
<br> In the middle of the night, and you're fast asleep, my love. 
<br> Stay awake looking at your beauty, 
<br> Telling myself I'm the luckiest man alive.<br>

<br> 'Cause so many times I was certain 
<br> You was gonna walk out of my life, life.
<br> Why you take such a hold of me, girl, 
<br> When I'm still trying to get my act right? <br>

<br> What is the reason when you really could've any man you want? 
<br> I don't see what I have to offer. 
<br> I should've been a season. 
<br> Guess you could see I had potential. 
<br> Do you know you're my miracle? <br>

<br> I'm like a statue
<br> Stuck staring right at you.
<br> Got me frozen in my tracks.
<br> So amazed how you take me back
<br> Each and every time our love collapsed.<br>


<br> Statue
<br> Stuck staring right at you.
<br> So when I'm lost for words
<br> Every time I disappoint you,
<br> It's just 'cause I can't believe
<br> That you're so beautiful.
<br> (Stuck like a statue)
<br> Don't wanna lose you. No.
<br> (Stuck like a statue)<br>


<br> Ask myself why are you even with me
<br> After all the shit I put you through?
<br> Why did you make it hard so with me?
<br> It's like you're living in an igloo.<br>


<br> But baby your love is so warm it makes my shield melt down, down.
<br> And every time we're both at war you make me come around.<br>


<br> What is the reason when you really could've any man you want?
<br> I don't see what I have to offer.
<br> I should've been a season.
<br> Guess you could see I had potential.
<br> Do you know you're my miracle?<br>


<br> I'm like a statue
<br> Stuck staring right at you.
<br> Got me frozen in my tracks.

<br> (Stuck like a statue)
<br> Don't wanna lose you. No.
<br> (Stuck like a statue)
<br> And you're so beautiful.
<br> (Stuck like a statue)
<br> Don't wanna lose you. Never.
<br> (Stuck like a statue)
<br> Oh, no.<br>


<br> Every single day of my life I thank my lucky stars.
<br> God really had to spend extra time when he sculpted your heart.
<br> 'Cause there's no explanation.
<br> Can't solve the equation.
<br> It's like you love me more than I love myself.<br>


<br> I'm like a statue<br>
<br> Stuck staring right at you.

<br> (Girl, you are the reason)
<br> Stuck like a statue.
<br> (The reason for living)
<br> Don't wanna lose you, no.
<br> (The reason for breathing)
<br> Stuck like a statue.
<br> (You're so beautiful)<br>


<br> And you're so beautiful.
<br> (And I want you to feel it)
<br> Stuck like a statue.
